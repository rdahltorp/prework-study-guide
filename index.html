         <li>A margin indicates how much space we want around the outside of an element.</li>
         <li>A padding indicates how mych space we want around the content inside an element.</li>
         <li>A selector is the item called out in the front of a CSS rule and proceeds the declaration. Think of it as the item(s) that will be affected by the rule.</li>
         <li>To have the rule apply to everything on the page use the '*' symbol as the selector.</li>
         <li>To set a class attribute, you need to create a class selector, which is done by placing a '.' before the identifier (like 'card' in the example of this site). The '.' signifies that this is a class selector.</li>

          <li>git status: checks what branch we are currently on.</li>
          <li>git checkout -b branch-name: creates a new branch and switches to it.</li>
          <li>always check to make sure your branch is running off the most recent code by using the following command: <em>git pull origin [name of main branch]</em>.</li>
          <li>To get ready to push your latest feature to GitHub and merge with the main branch:</li>
            <ol>
              <li>Confirm you are in the proper working branch that you have been updating.</li>
              <li>Stage your changes by entering command: <em>git add -A</em>. This tells git to expect that all the items staged will be sent in a pull request.</li>
              <li>Now, to commit the staged changes to the repo, use the command: <em>git commit -m [INSERT A SMALL MESSAGE ABOUT THE COMMIT]</em>. The -m flag notes an associated message.</li>
              <li>Confirm the branch code you are working off of is the most upto date with command: <em>git pull origin [NAME OF YOUR MAIN BRANCH]</em>.</li> 
              <li>If display says you are up to date, it is time to push with command: <em>git push origin [WORKING BRANCH NAME]</em>.</li>
              <li>Then your pull request should be in GitHub!</li>

        <h2>JavaScript</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>A variable is a named container that allows us to store data in our code.</li>
          <li>To declare a variable, we use the keyword "var" followed by the individual key word.</li>
          <li>So assign specific data to a variable we use "=" followed by the data we want stored. For example: <strong>var shape = "circle";</strong></li>
          <li>The "control flow" is a term that means the order in which the browser reads the code. This flow can be interrupted by certain code, but for the most part it reads from top to bottom. So if something is broken in the code, make sure the code in the control flow makes linear sense!</li>
          <li>If any copy needs to be displayed to the user in the console or if anything needs to be printed we use "console.log".</li>
          <li>To “comment out” code (i.e. make it inactive) surround it with “/*” and “*/”.</li>
          <li>Conditional statements in JS inform the browser of an action that needs to be take should the conditions be correct. To develop these we use an "if" statement, meaning if something is truthy the code will execute. We can also add "else" statements to our conditional which will execute should the conditions not meet the original "if".</li>
          <li>A function is simply a set of instructions that tells the computer how to perform a certain task. Functions do not run automatically like loops or conditional statements, they must be called to run.</li>
          <li>2 key parts of a function: </li>
            <ol>
              <li>Define the function</li>
              <li>Call the function</li>
            </ol>
          <li>To declare a function we include the keyword function at the start and follow it up with the individual name of the function + parenthese and a code block surrounded by curly brackets. For example:
            <br>
            <strong>funcion anExample() {
            <br>
              //Code block 
            <br>
            }</strong>
          </li>
