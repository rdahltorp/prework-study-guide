         <li>A margin indicates how much space we want around the outside of an element</li>
         <li>A padding indicates how mych space we want around the content inside an element</li>
         <li>A selector is the item called out in the front of a CSS rule and proceeds the declaration. Think of it as the item(s) that will be effected by the rule </li>
         <li>To have the rule apply to everything on the page use the '*' symbol as the selector</li>
         <li>To set a class attribute, you need to create a class selector, which is done by placing a '.' before the identifier (like 'card' in the example of this site). The '.' signifies that this is a class selector</li>

          <li>git checkout -b branch-name: creates a new branch and switches to it</li>
          <li>always check to make sure your branch is running off the most recent code by using the following command: <em>git pull origin [name of main branch]</em></li>
          <li>To get ready to push your latest feature to GitHub and merge with the main branch:</li>
            <ol>
              <li>Confirm you are in the proper working branch that you have been updating.</li>
              <li>Stage your changes by entering command: <em>git add -A</em>. This tells git to expect that all the items staged will be sent in a pull request.</li>
              <li>Now, to commit the staged changes to the repo, use the command: <em>git commit -m [INSERT A SMALL MESSAGE ABOUT THE COMMIT]</em>. The -m flag notes an associated message.</li>
              <li>Confirm the branch code you are working off of is the most upto date with command: <em>git pull origin [NAME OF YOUR MAIN BRANCH]</em></li> 
              <li>If display says you are up to date, it is time to push with command: <em>git push origin [WORKING BRANCH NAME]</em></li>
              <li>Then your pull request should be in GitHub!</li>
